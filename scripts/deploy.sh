# deploy.sh — reliable local deploy of the Noetica desktop app.
#
# Fixes the class of bug that silently undermined development: `tauri build` CACHES the externalBin,
# so a backend-only change rebuilt the agent-machine binary but shipped a STALE one inside the .app.
# This script rebuilds the binary clean, embeds the FRESH one, and then VERIFIES the deployed binary
# hash matches the freshly-built one — failing loud on any mismatch — so "what's deployed == what was
# built" is guaranteed, not assumed. Also handles the macOS launch flakiness (lsregister reset).
#
# Usage:  bash scripts/deploy.sh            # build + deploy + launch + verify
#         NO_LAUNCH=1 bash scripts/deploy.sh  # build + deploy, don't open
